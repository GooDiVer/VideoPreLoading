# VideoPreLoading
Demo for video PreLoading/ PreCaching using ExoPlayer 2.11 in Android.

With this project we used some dome videos URL's and Adnroid intent service to preload/precache those videos in background.
If a video is found cached the player will use local cache to play those videos otherwise will load it from server.

NOTE: This project was build in Android studio 4.0 Beta version. So it will say incompatible gradle if you try to compile it in Android Studio's old versions like 3.5 or 3.6.
